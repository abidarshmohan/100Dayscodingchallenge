Day 66 coding Statement : Palindromic substrings

Anoop likes strings a lot but he likes palindromic strings more. Today, Anoop has two strings A and B, each consisting of lower case alphabets.

Anoop is eager to know whether it is possible to choose some non empty strings s1 and s2 where s1 is a substring of A, s2 is a substring of B such that s1 + s2 is a palindromic string.

Here '+' denotes the concatenation between the strings.
